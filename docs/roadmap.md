# Nova Roadmap

This roadmap orders work by semantic dependency. A phase is complete only when
its implemented behavior is documented, tested, and exercised by CI. Later
phases may be researched in isolation, but they do not become product claims or
stable syntax ahead of their prerequisites.

## Phase 0 — Language constitution

**Status: initial baseline in this repository.**

- goals, non-goals, and design constraints;
- provisional lexical and syntax policy;
- value, mutability, name, error, effect, memory, concurrency, module, package,
  unsafe, compatibility, and implementation directions; and
- an explicit unresolved-research register.

Completion of the initial document does not freeze unfinished semantics.

## Phase 1 — Executable frontend foundation

**Status: first vertical slice implemented; broader grammar work remains.**

- Rust workspace and official `nova` CLI bootstrap;
- source identity, exact spans, and locations;
- structured human and JSON diagnostics;
- lexer and parser for the grammar in `docs/grammar.md`;
- AST inspection with `nova ast`;
- positive, negative, span, precedence, overflow, comment, recovery, and depth
  tests; and
- Rust 1.85 MSRV checking plus current-stable formatting, Clippy, test, build,
  and rustdoc CI.

Next Phase 1 refinements should be driven by the needs of name resolution, not
by adding unrelated syntax.

## Phase 2 — Semantic core

**Status: in progress; deterministic single-file name resolution is
implemented.**

- purpose-built resolved HIR with dense session-local symbol IDs;
- lexical scopes, forward/recursive function lookup, duplicate diagnostics,
  unknown-name diagnostics, and built-in type-name resolution;
- `nova check` upgraded from syntax validation through name validation;

Remaining Phase 2 work:

- define primitive `Int` and `Bool` typing and operation semantics;
- function signatures, local inference, binding mutability, calls, operators,
  block tails, and `if` branch typing;
- type-mismatch diagnostics and a typed HIR contract.

## Phase 3 — Executable language subset

**Status: planned.**

- a small verified interpreter or simple execution IR;
- functions and control flow;
- records, enums, and exhaustive pattern matching; and
- deterministic execution and semantic fixture tests.

The backend choice will follow evidence from the Phase 2 HIR rather than
precede it.

## Phase 4 — Typed errors and effects

**Status: research required.** Specify recoverable errors, propagation,
interfaces, effect inference, cancellation, and panic boundaries before adding
surface syntax.

## Phase 5 — Generics and traits

**Status: planned.** Define coherence, inference boundaries, specialization
policy, and compilation strategy with diagnostic quality as a primary metric.

## Phase 6 — Ownership, regions, and resource lifetimes

**Status: research required.** Prototype and measure the hybrid memory model.
Do not label Nova memory safe until accepted programs and unsafe boundaries are
checked by an implemented model with adversarial tests.

## Phase 7 — Stable intermediate representation and native backend

**Status: planned.** Introduce verified MIR, explicit layout and ABI rules,
optimization contracts, debug information, and an initial native backend.

## Phase 8 — Structured concurrency

**Status: research required.** Add scoped tasks, cancellation, race-freedom
rules, and executor contracts only after effects and ownership can express them.

## Phase 9 — Package and build ecosystem

**Status: planned.** One official manifest, resolver, lockfile, package tool,
formatter, linter, test runner, documentation generator, and reproducible build
protocol.

## Phase 10 — WebAssembly backend

**Status: planned.** Reuse verified shared IR; document target restrictions and
component/host interoperability without creating a Wasm-only language dialect.

## Phase 11 — C interoperability

**Status: planned.** Specify ABI, layout, ownership, error, callback, and unwind
boundaries; add narrowly classified unsafe capabilities and conformance tests.

## Phase 12 — SIMD and GPU research

**Status: research required.** Determine which shared-IR abstractions preserve
Nova semantics and which target constraints require explicit APIs or effects.

## Phase 13 — Self-hosting

**Status: long-term.** Begin only after the language subset needed by the
compiler is stable, bootstrap reproducibility is demonstrated, and builds can
compare trusted Rust-bootstrap and Nova-hosted outputs.
